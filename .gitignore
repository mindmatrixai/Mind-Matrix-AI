.gitignore – Keeping Mind Matrix Clean & Secure 🚀
Welcome to the Mind Matrix AI Blockchain Repository! 🧠🔗 To keep our codebase lightweight, secure, and efficient, we use a .gitignore file. This ensures that unnecessary files, sensitive data, and system-specific junk don’t get committed to our repo.

Think of it as a firewall for your Git commits—only the essential code makes it in! 🛡️💡
🔹 OS & Editor-Specific Files
Avoid committing system-generated files that clutter your repo:

graphql
Copy
Edit
.DS_Store  # macOS metadata files  
Thumbs.db  # Windows thumbnail cache  
.idea/     # JetBrains (PyCharm, WebStorm) project files  
.vscode/   # Visual Studio Code workspace settings  
🔹 Python Dependencies & Virtual Environments
Exclude installed packages and virtual environments to keep the repo clean:

markdown
Copy
Edit
venv/  
__pycache__/  
*.pyc  
*.pyo  
Pipfile.lock  
🔹 Node.js & JavaScript Dependencies (if applicable)
Prevent committing bulky node_modules/:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
node_modules/  
package-lock.json  
🔹 Environment & Security Files
Sensitive credentials should NEVER be committed:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
.env  
config.json  
secrets.json  
🔹 Logs & Debugging Files
Logs should be ignored to prevent unnecessary commits:

lua
Copy
Edit
logs/  
*.log  
debug.log  
🔹 Compiled & Build Files
Exclude compiled binaries and temporary build artifacts:

markdown
Copy
Edit
dist/  
build/  
*.exe  
*.dll
