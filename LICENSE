LICENSE – Protecting Mind Matrix’s Code & Community 🛡️🔗
The LICENSE file is one of the most critical files in your Mind Matrix repository. It defines how others can use, modify, and distribute your code while ensuring your rights as the creator are protected. Without a license, your project’s legal status is unclear, which could limit contributions and adoption.
